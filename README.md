## General info
Nowadays, many people commission blood-tests without consulting a doctor, and only a few of them know, how to interpret the results of these tests afterwards.
The main objective of this project was to create an app, that would return a message about user's health.
LabApp is an app based on simple forms, consisting in entering results of laboratory tests in form fields and receiving an interpretation of these results.
Another functionality available from the menu is a section with brief information about selected test.
